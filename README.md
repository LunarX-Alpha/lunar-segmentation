# Image Segmentation on Artificial Lunar Landscape Dataset

## Abstract

An implementation of PyTorch's UNet Model for Image Segmentation on Artificial Lunar Landscape Dataset that also works on Intel® OpenVINO™


## Motivation

In space robotics particularly to the exploration of the moon, we rely on the power of lunar rovers, partially or fully autonomous vehicles that navigate on the surface of the moon. The obvious challenge on operating these vehicles is how we can safely navigate these into steep and rocky terrains. Like what Kobie Boykins, an engineer in JPL's spacecraft mechanical and engineering division said on his [2011 interview for Space.com](https://www.space.com/12482-moon-car-lunar-rover-apollo-15-legacy.html), we needed to then figure out how to drive over rocks and drive on steeper inclines. This could not have been any more true especially when these rovers are miles away from us, and we spend millions, if not billions for these space missions.

But this interview is about a decade ago. The very same year, we have had [incredible milestones towards deep learning and computer vision](forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/12/31/the-most-amazing-artificial-intelligence-milestones-so-far/#4968a43b7753) and these milestones kept pushing the limit as to what we can do. The year is 2020 as of this writing that we these vehicles can be aided by state-of-the-art computer vision models that would allow for detecting large rocks on
